# Portfolio.
Welcome to my Portfolio. Here you can see my progress and work that I have been involved in in order to develop as a professional in what I love.
I am a Python developer & Data Analyst Jr. I value the possibility of working in challenging environments that propose professional progress, always surrounded by a collaborative 
team that allows me to enrich myself personally.

Each folder in this repository has different themes, either: applications, games and web pages. Enjoy it!
Tools used: Python, Django, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Power BI, SQL, CSV, Photoshop.

My current goal is to have a job as a developer to improve my skills and thus be able to advance in my studies as a data scientist.
